                                <p>"As an SPJ student, campus life is honestly both fun and challenging. like, it‚Äôs not just the usual school stuff; naa gyuy extra effort needed, especially with meeting the deadlines sa articles, covering events, and balancing academics at the same time. plus, my life is super busy with so many commitments pero fulfilling siya in a way nga you feel productive and involved. but honestly, i‚Äôve been an SPJ student since elementary, so i‚Äôve gotten used to the pressure and workload. it‚Äôs really challenging for everyone and for me but it‚Äôs also something that has shaped me over the years. it‚Äôs something i‚Äôve grown to enjoy.

                                    Naay times nga kapoy kaayo, especially if mag dungan tanan‚Äîexams, projects, and journalistic duties‚Äîbut it‚Äôs also rewarding when you see your work published or when people appreciate what you do. it reminds me why i started in the first place and makes it all worth it. writing and being part of the SPJ community feels like second nature na for me and gives me a sense of purpose. there are definitely times when it feels overwhelming and sometimes i barely have time for myself but despite that, it‚Äôs fulfilling jod at the same time, knowing nga your work matters and contributes to something bigger.
                                    
                                    Overall, it‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs worth it and rewarding. and despite all of that, my campus life as an SPJ student and being in SPJ has taught me how to manage my time and responsibilities, work under pressure, stay passionate about writing and storytelling, and keep pushing forward even during tough days, and also enjoy the little wins along the way. even with the challenges, it‚Äôs a journey i wouldn‚Äôt trade for anything."</p>

                                <p>"As an STE student, my campus life has been a mix of highs and lows, much like the turning of a wheel. During the times I‚Äôve been "above the wheel," I‚Äôve had opportunities to join competitions such as science fairs and school press conferences, which have allowed me to grow, learn, and meet new people.  

                                    However, there are also moments when I‚Äôve been "below the wheel." These moments include sacrifices like sleepless nights and skipped meals to keep up with the demands of excelling in my studies and extracurricular activities.  
                                    
                                    Despite the challenges, my campus life has been fulfilling, thanks to my supportive friends who stand by me through every up and down. My classmates, though we sometimes have misunderstandings, have also played a big role in making my campus life safer, more enjoyable, and fun. Lastly, the teachers I‚Äôve encountered have been instrumental in guiding and inspiring me to reach my goals.  
                                    
                                    Overall, my campus life as an STE student is both challenging and rewarding, filled with meaningful experiences and valuable connections."</p>

                                <p>"Being a STEM student in the campus can be a rollercoaster experience but definitely a must. It allows us to enjoy the ride even if it means that it doesn't necessarily move in a straight and smooth trail. As a STEM student I could definitely say that its quite challenging given that the competencies can be quite advance, plus responsibilities, and expectation that I personally ought to meet. But despite these things being a STEM student can also be satisfying and fulfilling  especially when I get to accomplish trials that I doubt that I can pass, in STEM there is a continuous learnings, self discovery and fun. Even though for most people they would perceive STEM strand as a difficult strand to enter and it is only for students who are what they call "smart", but I can attest that everyone can enter STEM as long as you have the drive to really work hard and do your best in your studies. ü§ç"</p>

                                <p>"As a Humanities and Social Sciences student, my campus life is a whirlwind of thought-provoking discussions,debates, and endless pages of reading and writing. It's challenging, but in a really rewarding way.  I'm constantly learning about different perspectives and ways of thinking, especially that our teachers expect us to understand people way better,may it be in the way they think and act since we cover so much in psychology and sociology and at the same considered as psychology students.  There's a lot of reading and writing, which can be tough sometimes, but maybe it's not that hard for me anymore since i am a journalist and i already know the basics specially in writing but at the same time I'm still improving my communication and writing skills. Of course, its not easy, Balancing academics and extracurriculars can be tough since i joined two organizations (BSP and Journalism) and some days I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of deadlines.But overall, it's a really enriching experience,I wouldn't trade this for anything and I feel like I'm developing a strong foundation for whatever I choose to do in the future."</p>

                                    And also being SPA STUDENT is vibrant, creative, and dynamic. Since we are  focusing on developing students‚Äô artistic talents alongside our academic subjects, daily life is often a mix of regular classes and specialized training in various art forms like music, dance, visual arts, theater, creative writing, or media arts. But the most enjoyable is SPA RECITAL"</p>

Yeah It‚Äôs hard but also really enjoyable. The subjects can be tough, especially with all the shifting and adjustments we have to make. Sometimes it feels overwhelming, pero I‚Äôm getting the hang of it.

                                    There are so many opportunities out there, like internships and events that can help me/us all grow. Plus, the friends I‚Äôve made along the way make everything cooler. We support each other through the stress and celebrate our wins together. it‚Äôs a mix of hard work and fun experiences that I wouldn‚Äôt trade for anything.
